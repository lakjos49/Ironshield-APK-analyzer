# Ironshield-APK-analyzer
This project implements an Android Malware Detection System using multiple machine learning algorithms to classify Android applications as benign or malicious based on their permissions and manifest features. Instead of executing APK files, the system analyzes their manifest-level information—primarily permissions, components, and metadata.
